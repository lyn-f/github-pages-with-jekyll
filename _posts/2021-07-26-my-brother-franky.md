When I asked my mom and dad for a little brother, I didn't expect him to be a *cat*.

My brother's name is Franky, and he is four years old. He's pretty cool, but he doesn't let me sniff his butt, and he's too small to play tug-of-rope with me.

Despite being small, he has a really **LOUD** voice! Some days he will wake me up before the sun comes up!

We may as well have gotten a chicken. He runs like a chicken every time I bark at the mailman. ðŸ“¬ 

But I still love him. He's great fun to wrestle with, but I always let him win.
